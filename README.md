# BookMeLocal
A website that allows users to book appointments with local businesses. The business, like a car mechanic, can tie their scheduler into this app, then users can select time slots. The user will then have a master calendar that has all of their appointments listed on it.


# BrainStorm Ideas
- Login Page
- Companies create an account and link their scheduler to this app. They then can login to see what appointments have been created. Future modifications would be to add the ability to push the appointments created in BookMeLocal to their local scheduler.
- User create an account.
  - They then search for "Car Mechanic" and get the results back
  - They click on the company they want to use (future additions would be to add google reviews to the page)
  - The companies calendar appears and they select a date and time to book an appointment.
  - When you click on a time slot, a modal appears asking what services they provide, you select which one you want, confirm the information, and then the appointment is added to your master calendar and the companies.
  - Personalize your profile with notification alerts, color schemes, time zones, link outside calendars, etc.
- Future addition to add a finance section that tracks how much you spent, companies can add invoices for your records, potentially tax forms, etc.

# To Do List
- Create 3 ficticious companies; 1 car mechanic, 1 barbershop, 1 landscape company
- Login Page
  - User Profile
  - User preferences for notification alerts, color schemes, time zones, link to outside calendars
- Search Page
  - Search for "mechanic" and the 1 ficticious car mechanic that we created appears
  - Click on that mechanic and their March calendar appears with ficticious bookings that are already created appears
  - You have to have the ability to select a time slot and create a booking
- When selecting a company/time slot to create a booking:
  - A modal appears with the necessary information to create the booking.
    - Your information will already be preloaded from your account
    - A drop down of the services that the company provides
    - Once a servies is selected, the amount of time needed to perform the task is presented and the calendar booking is created for that amount of time.
    - A text box that allows you to add notes to your booking
- When the booking is completed then it is added to the companies main calendar
